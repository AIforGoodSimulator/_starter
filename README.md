# Executive summary
Deutsche Bank will help model COVID-19
* Given the unprecedented societal impact of COVID-19, it became clear that crisis modelling of large populations, would be essential for strategies to manage the virus and its transmission
* Our focus on engineering culture and technological innovation, meant that DB could not only offer computational power, but also the expertise behind it, and a sand-box to play-in
* Data insights engaged with the AI/ML Community of Practice and DBIO to explore how the bank could best collaborate with external research groups
* We decided to partner with AI for Good, as they had already established a ‘Simulator’ to model the potential contagion impact of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a refugee camp
* We aspire to provide value to our NGO partner such that refugee camp managers around the world can use the app to reduce and mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak and potentially save lives
