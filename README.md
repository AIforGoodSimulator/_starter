# Executive summary
Deutsche Bank will help model COVID-19
* Given the unprecedented societal impact of COVID-19, it became clear that crisis modelling of large populations, would be essential for strategies to manage the virus and its transmission
* Our focus on engineering culture and technological innovation, meant that DB could not only offer computational power, but also the expertise behind it, and a sand-box to play-in
* Data insights engaged with the AI/ML Community of Practice and DBIO to explore how the bank could best collaborate with external research groups
* We decided to partner with AI for Good, as they had already established a ‘Simulator’ to model the potential contagion impact of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a refugee camp
* We aspire to provide value to our NGO partner such that refugee camp managers around the world can use the app to reduce and mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak and potentially save lives

# Welcome!
Introduction
* AI For Good is an external organisation focused on harnessing AI for socially, ethically and environmentally positive themes and problems. In particular AI For Good has initiated a volunteer programme called the AI For Good Simulator, which is creating coronavirus modelling, visualisation and reporting solutions for NGOs involved in refugee camps around the world.
* DB volunteers and others are welcome to join, collaborate and contribute. Microsoft have kindly provided a dedicated Azure cloud compute/storage environment, based on DB Hackathon.
* This starter pack will provide you the information you need to start the journey. 

Coronavirus simulator
* The challenge is to model and understand the dynamics and variables or the spread of disease (COVID-19) using data science and mathematical models. In particular there are three models, in varying stages of development and in a number of programming languages, for simulating coronavirus spread and effects in refugee camps, based on configurable camp parameters and inputs.
* The initial ask with respect to the DB volunteers has centred around providing assistance for:
  - Visualisation
  - Web applications
  - Technical and Infrastructure
* While the design, engineering and delivery of such are recognised as “Product Team” concerns, DB assistance in other areas is also welcome and encouraged.
